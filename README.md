# Java Design Patterns

Welcome to the **Java Design Patterns** repository! This project provides implementations of popular design patterns in Java, with clear examples and explanations. Itâ€™s designed to help developers understand and apply design patterns to create clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## About

This repository includes examples of commonly used design patterns in Java. Each pattern is implemented in a separate folder with code and documentation to demonstrate:
- The problem the pattern solves
- Key components of the pattern
- How the pattern is applied in real-world applications

## Getting Started

To clone and run the repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Meeru3819/Design-Patterns.git
   ```
2. Alternatively, import the project into an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse and run individual examples.

## Patterns

### Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton**  
   Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/creational/singleton)

2. **Builder**  
   Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.  
   [Example Code](Builder)

3. **Factory Method**  
   Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/creational/factorymethod)

4. **Abstract Factory**  
   Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/creational/abstractfactory)

5. **Prototype**  
   Creates new objects by copying an existing object, making it easy to add new types.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/creational/prototype)

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter**  
   Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another expected interface.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/structural/adapter)

2. **Decorator**  
   Adds functionality to objects dynamically by wrapping them in objects of a decorator class.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/structural/decorator)

3. **Facade**  
   Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/structural/facade)

4. **Proxy**  
   Controls access to an object, allowing certain actions to occur only when conditions are met.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/structural/proxy)

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Observer**  
   Defines a one-to-many dependency, where when one object changes state, all dependents are notified and updated automatically.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/behavioral/observer)

2. **Strategy**  
   Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/behavioral/strategy)

3. **Command**  
   Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/behavioral/command)

4. **State**  
   Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/behavioral/state)

5. **Template Method**  
   Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.  
   [Example Code](src/com/yourpackage/behavioral/templatemethod)
